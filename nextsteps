I completed the account signup and edit profile. There''s some javascript autoloading the form filds with the data from the Auth::user object


Next I have to figure out what I'm going to do about the avatar image


Also, Need to create a link to submit a new background report request blade.

It will only be visible to authorized users, who value == profileComplete set to 1 or true.
  show warning that their profile
  is not completed or approved.


Start testing the background check API with the creds for Sterling
